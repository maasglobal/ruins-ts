# Ruins-TS

Ruins-TS is a library for ruining referential transparency of TypeScript projects.
It terminates pure functional types defined by [fp-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts).
Needless to say this voids the warranty of type safe libraries and should only be used
by developer who wish to live with the consequences.
